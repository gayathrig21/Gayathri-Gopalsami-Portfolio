# [Project 1: World Health Stats - 2020](https://github.com/gayathrig21/WorldHealthStats2020)

## EDA of Life Expectancy and Healthy Life Expectancy

Life expectancy gives an indication of how long a population is expected to live on average. 
But Healthy Life Expectancy (HALE) reveals the true health of a population. It's about both length of life and quality of life. Not just the number of years the average person lives, but the number of years they can expect to live in good health.

## Problem Statement 

To visualize the data by generalizing the plots into 2 main category -

1) World demographics on a timeline

2) World vs Region vs India trend

# [Project 2: Garment Industry Dataset](https://github.com/gayathrig21/GarmentIndustryDataset)  

## Productivity Prediction of workers using Garment Industry Dataset

The Garment Industry is one of the key examples of the industrial globalization of this modern era. It is a highly labour-intensive industry with lots of manual processes. 
Satisfying the huge global demand for garment products is mostly dependent on the production and delivery performance of the employees in the garment manufacturing companies. 
So, it is highly desirable among the decision makers in the garments industry to track, analyze and predict the productivity performance of the working teams in their   factories.

## Problem Statement

This dataset includes important attributes of the garment manufacturing process and the productivity of the employees which had been collected manually and also been validated by the industry experts. 
Sample data collected through the period from Jan 2015 to Mar 2015
It can be used for regression purpose by predicting the productivity range (0-1) or for classification purpose by transforming the productivity range (0-1) into 
classes.
To build a model which is efficient in either

predicting the productivity of the workers 

                                    (or)

predicting if the workers can achieve the set target

# [Project 3: Gene Expression Dataset](https://github.com/gayathrig21/Gene-Expression-Dataset)

## Dataset Analysis and ML Models for predicting cancer 'AML' and 'ALL' cancer types

Gene Expression dataset comes from a proof-of-concept study published in 1999 by Golub et al. It showed how new cases of cancer could be classified by gene expression monitoring (via DNA microarray) and thereby provided a general approach for identifying new cancer classes and assigning tumors to known classes. These data were used to classify patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

## Problem Statement
There are two datasets containing the initial (training, 38 samples) and independent (test, 34 samples) datasets used in the paper. These datasets contain measurements corresponding to ALL and AML samples from Bone Marrow and Peripheral Blood. Intensity values have been re-scaled such that overall intensities for each chip are equivalent.

-To build varous ML model to claasify the patient with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
